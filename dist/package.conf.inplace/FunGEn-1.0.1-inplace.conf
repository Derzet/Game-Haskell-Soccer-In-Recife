synopsis: A lightweight, cross-platform, OpenGL/GLUT-based game engine.
description:
    FunGEn (Functional Game Engine) is a BSD-licensed, cross-platform,
    OpenGL/GLUT-based, non-FRP game engine/framework written in
    Haskell. Created by Andre Furtado in 2002, it's the oldest Haskell
    game engine, and with very few dependencies and two example games,
    it's one of the easiest ways to get started with Haskell game
    development.
    The FunGEn library provides:
    * Initialization, updating, removing, rendering and grouping
    routines for game objects
    * Definition of a game background (or map), including texture-based
    maps and tile maps
    * Reading and intepretation of the player's keyboard and mouse input
    * Collision detection
    * Time-based functions and pre-defined game actions
    * Loading and displaying of 24-bit bitmap files
    * Some debugging and game performance evaluation facilities
    This package receives only basic maintenance (see home page).
